            <h2>What is Tarot? How does it Works and How to Learn Tarot Cards Online?</h2>
            <br>

            <p>Tarot is a set of wooden or cardboard cards with pictures on one side and symbolic illustrations on the other. 
                Often used for fortune telling,</p>
                <br>

                <p>So, We are here to provide anything you could possibly want to know about the cards, including how each card 
                represents a different element of spiritual energy and change, what symbols are found in each court card, what 
                readings can be performed using each card's assigned number or suit signifying its subject matter.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Tarot can be found in any form of literature, from mythology to history. The oldest known mention of a Tarot card is 
                the 16th century.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>The Tarot deck contains 78 cards and is divided into four suits: Cups, Pentacles, Swords and Wands. 
                The suits are derived from the four elements: cups represent water; pentacles represent earth or metal; 
                swords represent air or fire; and wands represent wood or life. There is a minor suit of cards called the court cards,
                which depict people known for their wisdom and virtue.
                The reader/crafter counts downwards from 22 (the Ace) to 11 (the Minor Arcana).</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>The origin of the Tarot is generally considered to be in Renaissance Italy, and some historians assert that it was 
                invented there, although there is also evidence of earlier use. In actual fact, the exact history of Tarot cards is 
                obscure.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>There are many books on the topic of card reading and Tarot readings in general. If this activity interests you,
                you can learn how to engage in it online or work with a live psychic who will be able to tell
                you more about what your future holds using more than just any old deck of cards.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>The information below is written for beginners who are looking to learn how to use the cards as a 
                divination tool.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>Tarot reading is often referred to as fortune telling, because it can predict your future or answer questions about 
                your past. There are many reasons why you might want to do this, but in short, you will be able to determine what 
                phase of life you are in and what elements you need to be working on in order for the transition to be favorable. 
                In other words, a Tarot reading tells you the past and present that have led up to that moment, and then it helps make
                 that there will not be any negative side effects or problems from occurring during that phase of your life.

                    This blog post is about tarot cards, asking your own
                    questions, and receiving answers. You may be thinking why in
                    the world would you want to ask the deck of cards a question?
                    Well it's all about getting insights as to what is happening
                    in your life from someone who isn't you or anyone else you
